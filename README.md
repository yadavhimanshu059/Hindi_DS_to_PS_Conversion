# Hindi_DS_to_PS_Conversion
The algorithm can be run with input SSF format of Hindi-urdu Dependency Treebank. It will generate Phrase structure trees for the corresponding dependency trees. Please see <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1779/10yadav.pdf">this paper</a> for more details.  

I have given a sample file of dependency trees that can be used as an input.

conversion.py is the main module which takes dependency tree as input (in the format given in sample_input file) and prints output PS trees (in form of bracketted notation).
